## Inspiration
I enjoyed the flutter workshop that was given Friday night, and decided to use this event to learn it.

## What it does
It was supposed to be a joke password manager that forgets your passwords.
Unfortunately, I had to fly solo and ran out of time.
Currently, it is login page and will append an array with instances of an account class.

## How we built it
It was built via flutter on vs code.

## Challenges we ran into
Time is an obvious challenge, but the greater issue was probably being on my own. As a solo dev with limited experience it took too long to get the UI set up. Because of this, I didn't have the opportunity to flesh out the features.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm proud that I took on the challenge of a new technology. Trying to absorb as much information as I could on my own was a fullfilling experience even if I wasn't able to create a functioning final product.
I was originally only planning to attend talks and workshops, but I'm proud that I put my head down and got to work.

## What we learned
For one, I learned that I really like flutter, but more importantly, that working with a team is crucial for being productive on a schedule. 

## What's next for Reliable Password Manager
I plan to finish it as a proper personal password manager.
Hopefully I will be able to deploy it across a few different devices and continue to develop it as a tool I actually use on a regular basis.
